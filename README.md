# Insert_Data_to_Sql_from_Server
 In this project, the server was created in C#, the data coming from the client to the server were added to SQL.   
 
 In this project, 8 different ports of an alarm system are discussed (P1,P2,P3,P4,P5,P6,P7,P8). Alarms coming to this alarm system come to the server we created. Then, the data received as parse to the server is inserted into SQL.
